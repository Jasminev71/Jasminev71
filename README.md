## 👋 About Me


Hi, I’m **Jasmine** (she/her/them) — a CS student and Software QA student building a career as a **QA Engineer**.

- 🎓 **Student:** CS undergrad at **SNHU** + Software QA Student at **Mountainland Technical College (MTECH)**  
- 🧪 **QA Focus:** Test automation, exploratory testing, API testing, and CI/CD  
- 💻 **Languages I use:** JavaScript, Java (with a growing interest in C# for automation)  
- 🚀 **Short-term goal:** Land my first QA role by combining strong fundamentals with real-world projects  
- 📚 **Currently learning:** Playwright, AWS Cloud basics, GitHub Copilot, and Azure AI engineering concepts  

I love breaking things **on purpose** and then figuring out *why* they broke.

## 🧪 QA & Automation Projects (Highlights)

> These are the repos I’d pin on my profile to show my QA focus.

### 🔹 UI Automation

  - Positive & negative flows  
  - Focus on selectors, waits, and clean assertions  

- 🧪 **[SauceDemo-Positive-and-Negative-Testing](https://github.com/Jasminev71/SauceDemo-Positive-and-Negative-Testing)**  
  Focused on **positive vs negative** scenarios to show QA mindset:
  - Valid vs invalid logins  
  - Edge cases around navigation and user flows  

### 🔹 QA Coursework & Test Design

- 📋 **[QA--MTECH](https://github.com/Jasminev71/QA--MTECH)**  
  Artifacts from my Software QA program:
  - Test plans & test cases  
  - Bug reports
    
- 📘 **[QA Capstone](https://github.com/Jasminev71/ThriftBooks-testing)**  
End-to-end QA documentation portfolio including a full test plan, test strategy, detailed test cases, exploratory testing notes, and defect reports for a real e-commerce workflow. Demonstrates professional QA processes, traceability, and clear communication.

### 🏅 Certifications

## 🎯 What I’m Focusing on Next

- ✅ Strengthening **Playwright + Javascript** for UI automation  
- ✅ Building **API testing** and **Postman** collections  
- ✅ Earning:, AWS Cloud/AI practitioner certs, and Azure AI Engineer(Jan 2026)
- ✅ Creating more **QA-focused repos**: performance testing, AI-assisted QA, and cross-browser testing demos  

If you’re a recruiter, mentor, or fellow QA/Dev — feel free to reach out, review my projects, or suggest ideas to break **even more** things in interesting ways. 🐛✨
